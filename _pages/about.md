After obtaining a Master of Engineering Degree from Ecole Centrale de Nantes (France) and a Master of Science Degree from the University Claude Bernard in Lyon (France), I did a PhD thesis at the University of Nantes in partnership with Orange Labs in Lannion. My research focused on extreme multi-label classification and dimensionality reduction. Since I completed my PhD in 2018, I have been doing applied research at [Wordline](https://worldline.com/) on Fraud Detection, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision.

## Research and Development 

All in all, I have been working in Research and Developement for large companies since 2012:
* At [Worldline](https://worldline.com/) Lyon (France) from 2018 to today, as a AI/ML researcher. I do research on several ML-related topics, I supervise interns and PhD candidate within the company or through academic partnerships (Hubert Curien Laboratory, ULB, University of Passau, ...). 
* At [Orange Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_S.A.) Lannion (France) from 2015 to 2018, as a PhD candidate and R&D engineer. I studied extreme multi-label classification and its application to natural language processing problems.
* At [Michelin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin) in Clermont-Ferrand (France), from 2012 to 2015, as an aspiring R&D engineer (in parallel of my Master of Engineering at Ecole Centrale). I studied the modeling of materials behavior and numerical simulation. 

## Research activites

* I have published in international journals (e.g. IEEE TKDE) and conferences (e.g. ICML, ICDM, IJCNN, IDA, ...).
* I filed several patents on credit card fraud detection.
* I have been a reviewer for AAAI2021, IEEE TKDE, BNAIC/BENELEARN 2019.

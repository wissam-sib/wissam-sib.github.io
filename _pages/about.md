After obtaining a Master of Engineering Degree from Ecole Centrale de Nantes (France) and a Master of Science Degree from the University Claude Bernard in Lyon (France), I did a PhD thesis at the University of Nantes in partnership with Orange Labs in Lannion. My research focused on extreme multi-label classification and dimensionality reduction. Since I completed my PhD in 2018, I have been doing applied research at [Wordline](https://worldline.com/) on Credit Card Fraud Detection, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision.
